I started this app in my last year of middle school, and had to abandon it halfway through.
I was trying to make simple todo page using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL (using xampp)
IT'S NOT COMPLETE, AND I WILL NOT COMPLETE IT.
If you need it for whatever reason, do whatever you want with it.
But i decided to start over, not using plain php/mysql(using xampp), but instead python(flask)/sqlite3, there should be repo named sth like 'todo v2'
